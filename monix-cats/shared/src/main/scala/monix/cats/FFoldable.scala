/** Data structures that can be folded to a summary value,
  * possibly lazily or asynchronously.
  *
  * The main operation is `foldLeftF` that folds `fa`
  * from left to right, or from first to last. Beyond this it
  * provides many other useful methods related to
  * folding over `F[A]` values.
  *
  * Note that a corresponding `foldRight` is not provided,
  * because that would be incompatible with large or infinite
  * streams.
